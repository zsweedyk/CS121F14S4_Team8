# PowerUp
PowerUp is an iPad puzzle game targeted to middle school kids who are interested in science. The game aims to teach kids the basic concepts of circuits and electricity while they enjoy the game at the same time. The current version is version 1.0 and the game is awaiting approval for the iPad App Store. This project was developed as part of CS 121 at Harvey Mudd College, as well as part of the Games Network, which is funded by NSF grant #1042472.
